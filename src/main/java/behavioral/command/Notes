Command pattern enables invoker delegate the request to the application via command. Here, invoker does not know about
application and specific concrete command. Invoker only provides hook for command interface such that application
specific logic can be executed on invoker request.

Client creates invoker by initialising it by appropriate concrete command and concrete command by application.

Situations
- This pattern can be used when request does not know about receiver and action to be taken.
- Helpful in building undoable system by storing execution steps.
- Building crash recoverable system because system stores execution steps.
